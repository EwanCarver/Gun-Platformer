### Gun Platformer (Current Personal Project)

### *Game Elements*
* Difficult platformer game (2d)
* You move by shooting the ground and the recoil propells you
* Get through various screens to reach the end, similar to celeste
* Barrel points towards mouse pointer, click to fire.
* Almost a foddian game maybe becasue of the difficult and imprecise movement

### *Core Game Loop*
* Try again and again to complete a screen
* Once you reach the next screen, you will respawn at the beginning of said screen
* Make it through all the screens! (Or as many as you can)
