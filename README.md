### Gun Platformer (Current Personal Project)

* Difficult platformer game (2d)
* You move by shooting the ground and the recoil propells you
* Get through various screens to reach the end, similar to celeste
* Barrel points towards mouse pointer, click to fire.
* Almost a foddian game maybe becasue of the difficult and imprecise movement
